**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**<br/>
The DriverPass project was a small web-app project from a company that was trying to break into a nice space for driving training. They noticed that there was an opportunity to provide quality driving training in a way that was more modern that traditional offerings. They wanted to us to develop a cloud based app available on all platforms that was highly reliable.

**What did you do particularly well?**<br/>
I think my particular strength on this project was attention to detail and ensuring that I met all the stated needs of the client. Also, considering security facrots that they has maybe missed, it is an ethical duty to make products as secure as possible.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**<br/>
I would revise the login schema, I had a long discussion with a friend about SSO (Single Sign On) and the fact that it is not a default security feature in literally everything is appalling. There are companies who claim to take security seriously, and yet they do not implement this technology as a core feature, [they charge extra for it](https://sso.tax/). So for me, not having implemeted this initially feels like a failing.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**<br/>
I interpeted the users needs based on the client's actual explicit requests and then also from my own perspective as a hypothetical user. I try to workshop out how I would use a system, and obviousely use case diagrams are incredibly helpful for this. It is important to consider user needs when designing a system because at the end of the day, the average user is not going to put up with a slow or unintuitive system. You need it to be quick, easy, responsive, and powerful in order to have a commercial success.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**<br/>
I approach designing software from a business function perspective first, and then I look at everything I would want as a user in regards to ease of use and so on. I think the best way to analyze and design a system is to build a strong client relationship and get as much information as you possibly can before pouring over that with your team and brainstorming to make use cases and figure out how the systme will work.
